 * ### CKFinder : Configuration File - Basic Instructions
 *
 * In a generic usage case, the following tasks must be done to configure
 * CKFinder:
 *     1. Check the $baseUrl and $baseDir variables;
 *     2. If available, paste your license key in the "LicenseKey" setting;
 *     3. Create the CheckAuthentication() function that enables CKFinder for authenticated users;
 *
 * Other settings may be left with their default values, or used to control
 * advanced features of CKFinder.

    // user logs in your system. To be able to use session variables don't
